# Probability-and-Statistics
In this repository, I intend to implement and explore some significant concepts in probability and statistics.

The concepts covered in the notebook file (.ipynb) include:

**1- Euler-Mascheroni constant**

**2- Newtonâ€“Pepys problem**

**3- Estimating the value of Euler's number "$e$" using the Monte Carlo method.**

**4- Random Fibonacci Sequence**

**5- A Circular Rule for Eigenvalues**

**6- An Examination of a Real Dataset**
